# **Hardware-Software Co-Design Projects**  

## **Overview**  
This repository contains various **HW/SW Co-Design projects**, where hardware acceleration is combined with software control to optimize performance and flexibility. These projects primarily leverage **ZYNQ-based SoCs**, utilizing **custom hardware IPs** integrated with software running on an embedded processor.

## **What is HW/SW Co-Design?**  
HW/SW Co-Design is an **engineering approach** where hardware and software components are developed together to optimize system performance. The hardware handles **computationally intensive tasks**, while software manages **control, data transfer, and flexibility**.

## **Key Features of My HW/SW Co-Designs**  
- **Custom IP Development:** Designing custom hardware modules in **Verilog/SystemVerilog**.  
- **AXI-based Communication:** Using **AXI4-Lite, AXI4-Stream, and AXI DMA** for efficient data transfer.  
- **Embedded Software Control:** Writing **C code** in **Xilinx SDK** or **Vitis** for software integration.  
- **ZYNQ-based Implementations:** Utilizing **ZYNQ Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL)**.  
- **Optimized Data Flow:** Ensuring efficient communication between hardware and software components.  

## **Projects in This Repository**  
### **1. Image Inversion IP**  
**Description:** A custom IP that processes an image by inverting pixel values. Data is transferred using **AXI DMA**, and a ZYNQ processor handles communication.  
- **Hardware:** Custom IP, AXI DMA, SmartConnect.  
- **Software:** C code for UART communication and DMA configuration.
